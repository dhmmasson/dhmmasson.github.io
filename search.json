    "text": "I am very happy with my 3rd successful entry in Ludum Dare. Deeper Trance is a very simple game with not one but two illusions :\n\nOne visual: all the display is an interactive image magic ( you may have seen them as kids ) that give you the illusion of depth\nOne auditory: The theme music is getting deeper and deeper in pitch continuously never stoping akin to a Shepard Tone\n\nThis game will led you into a deeper and deeper trance* as you descend deeper and deeper through the levels.! Let the music descend infinitely until you reach the deeper trance!\nYou loved magic images when you were a child where you could see 3D images hidden in seemingly random arrangement of dots! You wished that this 3d images could move and lead you into their world ? This game is made for you!\n*no guarantee. Some subjects are immune to trance and/or autostereogram! You should be able to read Deeper Trance in the above image.\n\n\nThe game use the autostereogram effect to make you see a 3d paddle that you can rotate to go through slit shaped holes at it fall deeper and deeper.\nThe game in itself is a classic take on a tunnel runner agility/fall-deeper-and-deeper-through-holes game.\nThe music is a shepard tone to continuously go deeper and deeper in pitch\n\n\n\n\nStart the game, you should relax your eyes to see at a greater distance than your screen. You should enter the image and a 3d horizontal bar should appear.\nRotate the bar with your left and right arrows.\nPlanes will move toward you, there is a slanted slit. Orient the bar to go through\nPress space to take a break\n\nThe game starts slows so that you can take your time to see the effect. If you miss the slit, it starts over. You can see your deepest score in the menu (space bar)\n\n\n\nThe game is hidden in the noise, you have to let your eyes get lazy. I added two kinds of help\n\nsquint hint : display to dots that can help you uncross your eyes. You should first see them double, then align the red and blue in the middle to see : red dot, mixed/superposed dots, blue dot.\nCheat mode : you see the depth map. Not funny but it might help you see what is hidden\n\nI still can’t see anything: some people can’t see autostereogram. I am deeply sorry, you can play in cheat mode, but it’s not a fun game."

The most fiddly thing was that I invented the riff on a guitar for which I now how to read tabs but not sheet music. But for composition and in particular harmony arrangement I know sheet music. Going from one to another was troublesome. I need to learn sheet music for guitar.\nI commited regularly on github so I can tell :\n\nI Had a game at 07:51:47 CEST without the shader. Three hours in !\nI had the first prototype 23:34! Exactly on schedule. It allowed me to test it with family\nCompo was released at 23:00 CEST (4h before the deadline) Fixing the hosted version on github.io and writing the post"

    "text": "For Ludum Dare 32, I set out to create something unique with a familiar foundation. The theme was “An Unconventional Weapon,” and I combined the classic mechanics of Minesweeper with innovative twists to make it more interactive and immersive. The result? MineSweepears Island, a hex-based puzzle game where your ears become the key to survival.\nMineSweepears Island is inspired by the traditional Minesweeper, but with a fresh perspective. Here’s how it works:\n\nThe game takes place on an island made up of hexagonal cells. Around 20% of these cells are trapped with hidden mines.\nUnlike classic Minesweeper, your goal isn’t just to avoid the mines but to create sweep paths across the island. The number displayed on each cell indicates two things: the number of adjacent trapped cells and the number of points the cell is worth.\nTo score higher, you need to create longer paths. The catch? Each cell can only be used once in a path, except when it’s used as the starting point for a new path. You have only 60 seconds to make as many paths and score as many points as possible.\n\n\n\n\nIn keeping with the theme of Ludum Dare 32, I gave players an unconventional tool to navigate the mines: sound. Instead of relying solely on visual clues, players use spatial audio to detect nearby mines. Here’s how it works:\n\nWhen you enter a tile, if there are mines in the surrounding cells, the game plays a tune.\nThe sound is spatialized, meaning you can determine which direction the sound is coming from, helping you guess which adjacent tiles are dangerous. You can probe if a tile is dangerous by getting closer to it. This introduces an extra layer of strategy, requiring players to not only focus on the numbers but also listen to the world around them.\n\nThe strategic depth in MineSweepears Island lies in balancing risk and reward. The longer the path and the closer you come to mines as you sweep across the island, the more points you earn. But, with only 60 seconds and a limited number of tiles that can be used in any path, you’ll need to plan carefully."

Originally the game was deployed on heroku, and the game was served by an express app that simply renders some .ejs template to dynamically generate the webpages.\nIn the views folder, I used EJS (Embedded JavaScript) to dynamically generate the webpages and connect the user interface with the game’s logic. The res folder contains code snippets I frequently use, including shaders and musical note frequencies like A = 440Hz, which helped fine-tune the audio cues in the game."

    "text": "Abstract\nTamarin is an open-source interactive alternative ranking system for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) designed to help users select the optimal technology alternatives based on their preferences and criteria. The software integrates quantitative and qualitative data to rank alternatives, considering user-defined importance and uncertainty levels. Tamarin’s dynamic user interface allows real-time adjustments, enabling users to set for each criteria, importance, and granularity, and observe the impact on rankings. Built for flexibility, Tamarin supports various decision-making scenarios, including refurbishment technology selection, washing machine comparisons, or any decision involving evaluated alternatives provided through CSV files."

    "text": "The INCOSE HSI 2024 conference will take place in the beautiful city of Jeju, Korea, from August 27 to 29, 2024. Previous INCOSE Human Systems Integration (HSI) conferences have been held in Biarritz (where I work) —I’m particularly excited about this year’s event. Not only does it offers me the opportunity to visit Korea for the first time but also this year’s conference is unique, being hosted along the 22nd Triennial World Congress of the IEA, bringing together a remarkable convergence of experts from around the globe. INCOSE HSI2024 is organized in collaboration with the International Ergonomics Association (IEA) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI)\nMy involvement in the INCOSE HSI Working Group and the conference as evolved across the years: Reviewer in 2019; I served as the Early Stage Research papers Co-Chairs in 2021. For the third edition, I have had the honor of serving as the Paper Chair for the conference, managing the paper submissions has been a rewarding experience, and I’m thrilled to announce that we received a total of 20 research papers, with an acceptance rate of 80%. In addition, we have 10 Early Stage research papers and 3 industrial papers that will be presented. The diversity and quality of these submissions reflect the innovative work being done in the field of Human Systems Integration. I will be serving as the session chair for both the opening ceremonies and the session on Model Driven System Engineering and I will be co-chairing the HSI Primer Writing Workshops. For those interested in exploring the full program, you can find more details here: HSI 2024 Program.\nI’m also proud to highlight the work of my PhD student, Alexandre Disdier, who will be presenting a paper titled “A Context Acquisition Methodology for the Design of Complex Sociotechnical Systems” Disdier et al. (2024) Alexandre has put forth an excellent piece of research, and I’m eager to see the discussions it will spark during the conference.\n\nConference Highlights\nTo be updated\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDisdier, A., Masson, D., Jankovic, M., & BOY, G.

    "text": "My friend Yann showed me a graph he wanted to replicate, where temperature anomalies were plotted by frequency rather than chronologically, resembling a Joy Division plot (Inspired by the album cover of Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division), the graph is created by counting the number of days each anomaly occurs per year and offsetting the resulting curve for each year. To enhance its appearance, I apply a Gaussian blur to smooth the values.\nYou can play with the parameters to see how the plot changes. The opacity, the scale of the years, the smooth factor, the color, and the option to start the plot from the bottom or to display only the anomalies.\nBelow are some technical details on how the data is processed and the plot is generated."

    "text": "Keep the Bees Alive is my entry to Ludum Dare 46\n\n\nThe idea of the game was to keep the bees alive by constructing a shelter with some random blocks. And also protect cactus from the rains so that they would flower… The bee hive is there, the cactus, the rain, the flower, the bees, the moving of the bits and things to build. The score board is there, the music is there, some sounds were there but I think i disabled them by accident… Everything is there but a real game… not much game testing, you can build you dont have to protect the bee hive so much as not destroing it. the cactuses need some water, but not to much. I forgot to do the dry part during the sunny part of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe bees are particles, At some point late in the development ( maybe on sunday, I should check the git log ) I had to add the bees ( they were in the title ) I didn,t had the time to program any kind of flight management ( nor the energy or a clue on how to do something believable) I had just finish messing about with the rain, so handling them as particles was kind of obvious. There are three kind of bees :\n\nthe ambient bees small that just buzz around the bee hive so it look more like a bee hive.\nThe angry bees that emit a bzzzz and buzz widly around the bee hive.\nthe wandering bees few and large, they circle around the main area ( with some speed over time in the particle management ). The cactuses have an attractor to help them “find” the flowers. On hitting a cactuses the score some points depending on the flower levels of the cactus. In the post mortem version I added some nice trail :)\n\n\n\n\nthe cactus are Plants, meaning they have water level associated with a number of flowers and a mesh. This allowed me to quickly manage the growing state. I just did multiple meshes in blender and link them to the same gameObject in unity. No need to fuss around where the flower should attach to the mesh and so on. I had plan on multiple cactus variants and other kind of flower with different water requirement ( the cactus in my original idea, needing no water and withering under the rain ) and the flower doing the contrary. In the LD version I have only one cactus with three states dry - flowering - too wet. In the post mortem version the cactus have more flowering states so that you see them growing. I should have added some instructions and some UI help to see more clearly the water requirement and actual level if I ever wanted to implement a better/richier version of this idea.\n\n\n\nthat was the fun part. From the beginning I wanted you to build a shelter from random junk as the set of the music video for staying alive is some sort of abandoned ruin of a village. Doors and windows are in shambles and that gave me the idea.\nMoving the pieces around in a direct way in 3d is tricky, I struggle to design in 3d in blender and in unity, both of them have different camera management and keyboard shortcut and this is a pain in the… In both software this is my biggest struggle. Being able to orbit around the correct point is something I experienced in my human computer interaction research lab years ago through the work a a phd student. Ever since I feel like a piece of me is missing… anyway I wasn’t going to invent something brilliant in a matter of 2 days. I sketched something I must have done in previous projects, using a spring joint to loosely connect object to the mouse.\nThe elasticity of the spring allows in some sense to compensate for the fact that the user is not part of the physical engine. Finding the right strength for the spring is the key. I opted for something quite hard and with a lot of damping so that the object don’t wiggle to much around. I also used quite heavy objects to stabilize everything.\nTo project where the user was pointing on the screen to a 3d position I used the native raycasting implementation. I opted for a two step process, if no object was selected the ray casting would intersect with the objects, left click sets the first anchor point. I like that the moving object anchor is set where you click on the object, rather than the center of mass. To highlight that a small sphere is visible on the object when you hover over it. ( The idea come from blender sculpt mode ). Once selected the object glow orange and the ray now intersect with a target plane.\nThe sphere, and the selected object are highlighted through the emission attribute from the shader. I discovered the emission parameter in some blender videos recently : I love the effect a bit to much. I am glad it worked well in the final version.\n\n\n\nIt was there in the template project, I just built upon to have 3 ambiances, one for the rain ( the one I used from the beginning ) a sunny, more yellow, less grain version, and a splash ( blurry ) version.\n\n\n\n\nTarget plane motion : moving the plane from front to back was plan but not implemented for LD ( it was heavily commented on ). I implemented that in the postmortem version\nPush mode : At first the target sphere had a collider and you could also push object around with it. I disabled it to finalize my spring action.\nGhost mode : the object is transparent to collision with the other will pressing ctrl and moving\n\n\n\n\n\nthere is a lot of brutal change of values. I’d love to have a easy to use continuous change of properties. gameObject.position.transition( vector3(0,0,0), 0.1f ) ;\nI made a lot of “state machine” : for the targetSphere, for the flowers, for the weather… I wish I had something more generic : Maybe something like the Animator in unity ?\n\nBig mistake : I had a memory leak in the cactus mesh update, where I was instantiating the mesh again and again. Not such a big deal in the LD version as there was only two variants. In the post mortem version, I added 3 new flowering states, and the ability for the cactus to dry. It got pretty bad pretty quickly."

I disabled it to finalize my spring action.\nGhost mode : the object is transparent to collision with the other will pressing ctrl and moving\n\n\n\n\n\nthere is a lot of brutal change of values. I’d love to have a easy to use continuous change of properties. gameObject.position.transition( vector3(0,0,0), 0.1f ) ;\nI made a lot of “state machine” : for the targetSphere, for the flowers, for the weather… I wish I had something more generic : Maybe something like the Animator in unity ?\n\nBig mistake : I had a memory leak in the cactus mesh update, where I was instantiating the mesh again and again. Not such a big deal in the LD version as there was only two variants. In the post mortem version, I added 3 new flowering states, and the ability for the cactus to dry. It got pretty bad pretty quickly."

The general UI of unity is somewhat lacking ( keyboard shortcuts ( why can’t a delete stuff without right clicking ), the shadergraph ui is clunky )\nI love that I was easy to have a physique systems, particles, shaders, sound and music without to much trouble.\nI did the game across the weekend, with time for the family. I mostly worked early in the morning during baby’s nap and until late at night. The last push was a blast.\nI spent way too long on small details and as always not enough on having a game. It lacks clear objectives or a compeling reward systems.\nThe game idea come from :\n\nOne of my first blender render, is an animation of a cactus characters in a desert.\nKeep it Alive, had me thinking about staying alive, the bee gees about bees and voila. The set is model to look like the set of the music video from the beegees.\n\nI hate the HoweverYouNameItCase where Methods/Properties start with a Capital letter! Using Atom without a good autocompletion/autofixing feature hinder me a lot.\nCompiling the web version took a lot of time, and resulted in botched shadows :("

Sebastien Lague youtube series on procedural game generation on unity hooked me. I loved how you could program the editor as well as the game. His videos taught me a lot on how to organize my code using scriptable object to store some game logic :\n\nthe “levels” are a collection of building blocks that drop from certain points. I had plan on having a succession of levels, where you had less and less blocks or smaller or harder block to place. You would start with the large stones, and planks and end up with the brick and branches In the end there is only one playable level with a collections of all the available blocks ( to show off the assets I had designed ).\nthe weather scenarios : are a collections of particles effects + post processing. Same idea than before. I planned to start with a succession of sun/rain where you would have a minute of sunshine to prepare ( one of the not selected theme ) before the rain. Harder level would have different weather effects ( thunder, hail ). I only manage one, I had fun playing with the particle effects and the collision with the cactus to actually simulate them being water by the rain. The splashing effect is lost on the resolution I think."

So I knew the HGSL and I can spend HOURS playing in shaders… not good for a compo. On the other hand I love graph programming ( grasshopper for Rhino is amazing for procedural 3d design ) and the shading graph in blender is very well made. It was a first for me to use Unity shader graph. I had seen some promising video online ( some force field, and a waterfall ). But man is the editor a pain in the butt… Moving around is a pain, Disconnecting a socket is a pain, adding a node is a pain. Why does unity hate keyboard shortcut (delete ??). It slow, clunky, berk! but you can plug and play some nice stuff. In the LD I finally didn’t do much. I used Imphenzia texture mapping technique in blender and in unity.\n\nI did something super cool but invisible : the wing of the bee bat through the shader. I mapped the x coordinate of the texture to a sinusoidal vertex displacement. In blender most of the bee vertex are mapped to some (0, Vc ) coordinate ( where Vc is the position of the color in the texture ). The wing vertex are map ( u, Vc ) where u is propotional to the position on the wing ( 0 close to the body, 1 at the tip ). Meaning that the vertex move more at the tip."

Imphenzia on youtube made it sound so simple to quickly model low poly models that I wanted to try for myself. The four softwares have a completely different take on how 3d modeling is done but this post mortem is already long enough so I won’t expand there too much. For some repetitive task like the stone around the door I would have done a better job on fusion or grasshopper. However Imphenzia UV mapping technique (mentioned in the Shadergraph section) allowed me to quickly color and texture the elements. It is very limited in what you can do, so no tweaking make for a speedy process. Blender on the mac tend to crash every so often, not on this weekend. Pray the software gods!"

It was done online on a web app called Noteflight. I have composed on and off on it for some time now. The music was heavily inspired by staying alive ( I started with the chords and some of the notes from parts harvested from google ). Then I just copy paste and tried some contrapunctal stuff… Anyway I badly copied the theme at some point… I can’t even hear it. In the end I slapped some trumpet, it always adds something that I like. I am quite proud of the music.\nThe sounds where created even latter, with even more stress about the remaining time. As it was super late, baby was sleeping; No noise allowed so I reverted to use Bfxr. I used it a long time ago, with no real or current experience of it creating realistic bump noise was a nightmare. Implementing the sound was terrible too. I wanted to cycle around some bump noises to avoid repetitiveness.

    "text": "Ludum Dare is a gam jam competition, that run online since 2002, where you have 48h to fully create a game, from design, to final code, art, music etc. I first discovered it after watching some YouTube videos by Quill18 in 2014. The idea of creating 100% of a game within 48 hours, sharing it with the community, making it [[open source]], and testing other players’ games immediately caught my attention. I loved the challenge, but even more, I fell in love with the supportive and creative community. Each time I participated, my passion for game development grew.\n\n\nMy first Ludum Dare was LD32 in 2015. The theme was “An Unconventional Weapon.” I created a variant of the Minesweeper game. Since I love [[hexagons]], I changed the grid to a hexagonal grid. Then instead of just clicking on tiles to reveal them one at a time, you have to explore the island to score points by sweeping across the tiles. More dangerous path earn more points. To help you can rely on an An Unconventional Weapon : your ears ! While you sweep you can hear contextual information about your surroundings (each mine emits a tune). The audio is spatialized, the closer you get from a mine the louder it gets, it is also panned left-right to help guide players. This one done using the recent web audio api at the time. I used various library to help me draw the island (a 3d graphical library called philoGl which was overkill for that 2d game).
