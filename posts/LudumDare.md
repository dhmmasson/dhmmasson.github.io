I have started ludum Dare after watch some youtube video of Quill18 and became found of the idea of doing 100% of the game in 48 hours for the sake of making a game and then sharing it, testing other player game. I fell in love with the community even more each time I participate.

- My first LD was Ld32, It was a take on a minesweeper on an hexagonal board. With the twist that you were supposed to sweep across tiles instead of moving one at a time. I added some spatialized (left-right) audio cue to help you. I did everything by hand in Javascript, used some of the latest audio 3d localization and audio synthesis available in javascript at the time! It was a **pain**, but I am proud to have rank #22 in innovation. You can still find the entry on the old website : [http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&amp;uid=51097](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=51097)
- Next entries where failure as I kept trying everything from scratch ( pure html, javascript ) It was frustrating and I stopped for a couple of year
- I came back to it for the LD46, with a new mindset of doing it during the weekend but still taking care of familly. I used Unity and Blender for the “first” time (I fired them up a couple of week before the game). It was a blast. My entry was beautiful (in my eyes) with 3d, a nice interaction, a great mood and music. But it was not a **Game**. Just a very nice sandbox playground where you can pile elements on top of each other. Interact with bees, watch the rain and the cactus flower grows.
- For LD48, the objective was **make a game first**, then add stuff! I ended up with the simplest of gameplay with a start, an end and a score! And then added the twists : An autostereogram effect in shader to perceive the depth and a _Deeper and Deeper_ music.

I really enjoy the review phase of LD, reviewing and commenting on game is super nice. I had some nice interaction with some of the developers and found some truly nice game, and game ideas for the future!

My tools currently are :

- Unity for game
- Blender for 3d art
- Noteflight for music composition
