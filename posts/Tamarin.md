# Abstract

Tamarin is an open-source interactive alternative ranking system for Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) designed to help users select the optimal technology alternatives based on their preferences and criteria. The software integrates quantitative and qualitative data to rank alternatives, considering user-defined importance and uncertainty levels. Tamarinâ€™s dynamic user interface allows real-time adjustments, enabling users to set for each criteria, importance, and granularity, and observe the impact on rankings. Built for flexibility, Tamarin supports various decision-making scenarios, including refurbishment technology selection, washing machine comparisons, or any decision involving evaluated alternatives provided through CSV files.
