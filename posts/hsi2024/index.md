The INCOSE HSI 2024 conference will take place in the beautiful city of Jeju, Korea, from August 27 to 29, 2024. Previous INCOSE Human Systems Integration (HSI) conferences have been held in Biarritz (where I work) —I’m particularly excited about this year’s event. Not only does it offers me the opportunity to visit Korea for the first time but also this year’s conference is unique, being hosted along the 22nd Triennial World Congress of the IEA, bringing together a remarkable convergence of experts from around the globe.

My involvement in the INCOSE HSI Working Group and the conference as evolved across the years:  Reviewer in 2019; I served as the Early Stage Research papers Co-Chairs in 2021. For the third edition, I have had the honor of serving as the Paper Chair for the conference, managing the paper submissions has been a rewarding experience, and I’m thrilled to announce that we received a total of 20 research papers, with an acceptance rate of 80%. In addition, we have 10 Early Stage research papers and 3 industrial papers that will be presented. The diversity and quality of these submissions reflect the innovative work being done in the field of Human Systems Integration. I will be serving as the session chair for both the opening ceremonies and the session on Model Driven System Engineering and I will be co-chairing the HSI Primer Writing Workshops. [For those interested in exploring the full program, you can find more details here: [HSI 2024 Program](https://easychair.org/smart-program/HSI2024/).]{.aside}

I’m also proud to highlight the work of my PhD student, Alexandre Disdier, who will be presenting a paper titled "A Context Acquisition Methodology for the Design of Complex Sociotechnical Systems" [@disdier2024_ContextAcquisition](../../publications/disdier2024_ContextAcquisition.md) Alexandre has put forth an excellent piece of research, and I’m eager to see the discussions it will spark during the conference.
