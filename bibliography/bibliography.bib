Our research aims at stretching MDE all over the design process including the creative phases so that to go beyond the well-known "fast-food UIs‟ limit of MDE. We propose to consider sketches and prototypes as models. This paper claims for storing these models in a graph so that to both inspire designers and support adaptation at runtime.},

  abstract = {My PhD thesis contributes to the engineering of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). It deals with the design of User Interfaces (UI). I claim that creative processes should be better considered, and supported by tools especially for novice designers. The challenge is to speed up the exploration of the design space at the early stages of the process. This claim is grounded in both a theoretical state of the art in creativity and creativity support tools, and in practice of the topic with four hands-on experiences of creativity in different areas of design such as architecture, product design and UI design. I build my contribution on the following principles: (1) creativity is not reserved for the elite, but can be tailored and fostered by software tools; (2) the tools must leverage motivation, inspiration, wide exploration, and knowledge in UI and design processes. Through a reflective process, I apply these principles to my thesis. I explore a wide range of creativity support tools through five complementary software contributions: Maestro and Bank for supporting knowledge capitalization; WebGallery, BrianStorming and Magellan for fostering inspiration and exploration of the design space. Maestro addresses the capitalization of design processes whilst BANK gathers knowledge in HCI as a graph of models. WebGallery is a gallery of websites to inspire designers: I report an experiment on human perception of websites styles. BrianStorming is a brainstorming assistant: it provides suggestions in a electronic brainstorming session. Magellan is an interactive environment based on genetic algorithms that automatically generate and transform UIs for a given design problem. This changes the role of the computer: from a simple tool, it becomes a designer's partner in the creative process.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the PRODEC scenario-based design method is the incremental crossfertilization and refinement of procedural scenarios and declarative configurations. It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system’s functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC’s use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins.},

We present the feedback we obtained from a series of semi-structured interviews with people involved in the development of military air traffic solutions. The participants' responses helped us establish methodological guidelines for designing and building a disruptive remote and virtual air traffic control center.

In studying the phenomenon of human Decision Making, the concept of Situation Awareness appears to be of primary importance when dealing with these complex systems. Given the complexity of the system to be represented in the DT, its own complexity, and the need to integrate the user’s abilities to allow the acquisition of SA, the concept of reality anchor is proposed to identify the elements of the studied situation necessary for users to perceive, understand and project the situation they face. A methodology, called the Reality Anchor Methodology, has been defined to ensure the elicitation and implementation of these elements in a DT. This methodology is composed of three steps that aim (1) to elicit the reality anchors through a study of the operators’ tasks and activities, (2) to design a prototype to carry out human-in-the-loop tests and (3) to validate the definition of Reality Anchors by analysing the SA, experience feedback and the activities performed during the tests. This method was applied to a case study in the oil-and-gas industry and showed the importance of the defined reality anchors.},

  abstract = {The textile industry is facing ecological and economic crises. Since the rise of fast fashion, the textile industry is one of the major and ever-increasing contributors to pollution and waste. Fashion brands are now producing twice the amount of clothing today compared with before the year 2000 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). In the meantime, more consumers become aware of both social and ecological risks in the textile industry and do not want to encourage such practices. In 2018, 44clothing and for 40people (18-25 years old) (Ditty, n.d.). This phenomenon reveals a growing consumer awareness and a growing distrust of the industry’s companies. A survey conducted in April 2020 across 2035 British and German consumers reveals that 64spend less on fashion during the crisis, and half of them expect that trend to continue after the crisis passes. As well, consumers are open to purchasing more durable fashion items, as well as repairing and keeping them longer. This survey reveals a shift in purchasing behavior, customers want to make informed purchases (Granskog et al., n.d.). The globalized and fragmented textile supply chain requires different laws and regulations (Fletcher and Grose, 2012) to improve its transparency. The paper is structured as follow: The first part presents the current situation regarding the transparency of information communicated by brands in store and online, and in the second part, we will describe what information could be shared with informed consumers, after an experiment with a product from a French luxury brand. The first part is the result of a study both in store and online about legal requirements and recommendations about traceability information related to products and environmental displays. We compare these requirements with actual data gathered in store and in online-shop. From our initial observations: The consumer survey by Fashion Revolution in 2018 and 2020 suggests that fashion labels should be transparent with the disclosure of information to consumers: Manufacturer’s address, the origin of fabric, and raw material(Fashion Revolution, 2018) (Fashion Revolution, 2020). In the second part of the article, we focus on the importance of traceability for gathering the information necessary for a full transparency. We leverage how information technology could be used to gather, collect, sort, and select information to render to the consumer.},

This paper reviews context definitions and builds a generalized definition of the operational context of complex sociotechnical systems. The objective is then to identify and extract context properties which are often implicit in the literature and do not necessarily appear in the definitions. However, eliciting them is helpful for understanding what context is made of, how it relates to complex sociotechnical systems comprising human and non-human agents, and how an early understanding of the operational context can prove valuable to designing efficient and robust systems. Our analysis is followed by an example of how our definition and derived properties apply to the case study of the design of a remote and virtual air traffic control center.},

A field study in the current fashion landscape evaluated the situation of actual practices concerning transparency and compared information available online and in-store regarding both product transparency and corporate transparency. The information available at the time of purchase is limited and even more so on the internet.

  abstract = {Refurbishing existing building into Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) is a key objective for the European Union. In order to achieve high rate of conversion, new refurbishment process must allow Decision Makers (DMs) (architects or designers) to sort through an ever increasing list of new technologies while taking into account uncertain preferences from multiple stakeholders. A Decision Support System (DSS) based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches is proposed. The DSS enables the DMs to browse the solutions space by selecting the relevant criteria, order them by preferences and specify the granularity in the assessment of the technologies regarding each criteria. This DSS is based on a ranking algorithm that operates on multiple types of quantitative (continuous, discrete, or binary) and qualitative (nominative or ordinal) variables from technological and human sources. An online user interface allows the real-time exploration of the solution space. A sensitivity analysis of the algorithm is conducted to expose the influence of the ranking algorithm parameters and to demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm. The proposed DSS is eventually implemented and validated through a use case concerning the choice of insulating materials considering heterogeneous criteria that model sustainable constraints.},

Precision Livestock Farming has allowed the sheeps and herds to be equipped with sensors and has a result the amount of data to be processed by farmers has surged. We argue that in order for the farmers to take appropriate actions there is a need for the development of a decision support system that take into account not only real-time data but also expert knowledge. In this work, we first highlight the specific challenges presented by the field of precision sheep farming to the development of a Cyber-Physical and Human System. We then introduce a methodology to implement a decision support in this context.},

  abstract = {Tinkering — or making small changes to experiment toward an improvement in performance — is seemingly a natural characteristic of many systems engineers. As such, systems engineers are uniquely qualified to develop complex solutions necessary to overcome lack of clarity, achieve order, and avoid failure. Further, there is a much broader conversation surrounding the possibility of “failure” being beneficial in systems engineering projects. In response to the needing to inform judgment in situations shrouded in uncertainty, members of INCOSE's Technical Leadership Institute (TLI) cohort 8 examined the role of safe-to-fail probes play in informing judgement for systems engineers. Within the constraints of the TLI's major project, virtual workshops and qualitative interviews were two data collection mechanisms established to empirically investigate the role(s) of safe-to-fail probing in systems engineering. Overall, the data sets offered conclusions describing the potential role(s) of safe-to-fail probes for systems engineers working in uncertain environments. Resulting from this (limited) empirical exploration are additional insights and implications for how systems engineers may invoke safe-to-fail probes to improve decision-making in uncertain and challenging situations. Such a tinkerer's mindset can help systems engineers transition from the constraints of “intolerable failure” to the opportunities related to probing-sensing-responding to “responsible failures.”},

As designers may have different needs during different thinking phases, accessing physiological responses in real-time would enable CSTs to better adapt to these different phases. Several studies have focused on either different phases on the same tool or the same phase on different tools. We investigate ways to discriminate divergent and convergent thinking phases using physiological response. We replicated the same experiment with thirty participants each on two different CSTs: in immersive virtual reality and on an interactive whiteboard (2D). We analyzed Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) during a divergent thinking task followed by a convergent thinking task. Our results revealed significant changes in arousal, measured through HRV and GSR, which seem specific to each creative thinking phase. We discuss how each phase can be linked with specific reactions independently of the CST. We suggest that it may be possible to detect a favorable creative state depending on the task being performed.},

La Conception Centrée Utilisateur contribue à atteindre ce succès en se concentrant sur les besoins des utilisateurs durant le processus de conception.

These needs are as well functional as hedonic. Designing products requires then to design hedonic properties affecting users’ perception. For sport products, people wants to improve their performances while maintaining their health. Sport products are then considered not only “sporty” but also “healthy”. Thus, integrating both health and sport expectations into the design process are necessary.Last decades, Affective Engineering was developed to integrate perception into the design process. Applying this approach for sport products may allow defining and mixing sport and health perceptual characteristics all along the design process. However, defining these characterisitics into requirements implies to translate them into semantic terms. If we observe semantic descriptors for sport products and for health products, they seem opposite. In this paper, we aim defining a semantic space representative and respectful of both domains, sport and health, while they oppose.},

These methods are studied as part of system engineering to satisfy various identified goals, and more specifically human-system integration, which is the topic of this paper. This article introduces the method used to define key elements of human perception of reality called reality anchors to design scenarios to be tested in a digital twin prototype. This method goes from regulation study to user cognitive function analysis on the specific case of digital twin designing in oil-and-gas industry. This method highlighted the differences between theoretical process and the followed process as well as tools and competencies used to identify reality anchors. This knowledge will then be used to implement a new process to be implemented with a digital twin and scenarios to test the prototype using realistic simulation.},

  abstract = {The work presented in this article focuses on the opportunity to use the digital twin of the complex system, a concept popularized in recent years, as a Decision Support System. In studying the phenomenon of human decision making, the concept of situation awareness appears to be of primary importance when dealing with these complex systems. Given the complexity of the system to be represented in the digital twin, the concept of reality anchor is proposed to identify the elements of the studied situation necessary for the user to perceive, understand and project the situation he is facing. A methodology, called the Reality Anchor Methodology, has been defined to ensure the elicitation and the implementation of these elements in a digital twin. This methodology is composed of three steps that aim (1) to elicit the reality anchors through a study of the operators’ tasks and activities, (2) to design a prototype for the realization of human-in-the-loop tests and (3) to validate the definition of the reality anchors. This method was applied to a case study in the energy domain and allowed to validate the importance of the defined reality anchors for the decision-making process.},

It is then necessary to develop a decision support system considering the "real time" data but also the expert knowledge to allow the farmers to act at best. In this work, we first highlight the specific challenges presented by the field of precision sheep farming to the development of a decision support system.

To support this process, a dedicated methodology called STAR (Structured and sTructuring Animation methodology for emeRgence) facilitates project emergence in interclustering and cross-sectoral context during innovation clubs. This deliverable gives animation guidelines to cluster facilitators of the NEPTUNE project in order to explain how the STAR methodology shall be used during the NEPTUNE innovation clubs sessions. Each step of the animation process is described following the same format: 1. prerequisites to check that the facilitator has enough information before starting a step, 2. description of the step, which details the aims and how to use the animation tools dedicated to this step, 3. expected outputs from the use of the STAR methodology. For each step, recommendations are specified to limit issues during animation and avoid misunderstandings. The STAR methodology intends to offer the best conditions to bring out innovation projects without claiming to be a systematic methodology to be exhaustively followed. Thus, the steps, advices and notes composing this document are to be taken as recommendations and should be adapted to each situation. To support clusters managers in animating the NEPTUNE innovation clubs sessions, this deliverable will be completed with a face-to-face Training session for clusters managers (D1.3).},
