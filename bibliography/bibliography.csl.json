It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system’s functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC’s use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Boy","given":"Guy André"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Durnerin","given":"Élise"},{"family":"Morel","given":"Chloé"}],"citation-key":"boy2024_PRODECHuman","container-title":"Systems Engineering","container-title-short":"Sys.

As designers may have different needs during different thinking phases, accessing physiological responses in real-time would enable CSTs to better adapt to these different phases. Several studies have focused on either different phases on the same tool or the same phase on different tools. We investigate ways to discriminate divergent and convergent thinking phases using physiological response. We replicated the same experiment with thirty participants each on two different CSTs: in immersive virtual reality and on an interactive whiteboard (2D). We analyzed Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) during a divergent thinking task followed by a convergent thinking task. Our results revealed significant changes in arousal, measured through HRV and GSR, which seem specific to each creative thinking phase.

In order to achieve high rate of conversion, new refurbishment process must allow Decision Makers (DMs) (architects or designers) to sort through an ever increasing list of new technologies while taking into account uncertain preferences from multiple stakeholders. A Decision Support System (DSS) based on Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches is proposed. The DSS enables the DMs to browse the solutions space by selecting the relevant criteria, order them by preferences and specify the granularity in the assessment of the technologies regarding each criteria. This DSS is based on a ranking algorithm that operates on multiple types of quantitative (continuous, discrete, or binary) and qualitative (nominative or ordinal) variables from technological and human sources. An online user interface allows the real-time exploration of the solution space. A sensitivity analysis of the algorithm is conducted to expose the influence of the ranking algorithm parameters and to demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm. The proposed DSS is eventually implemented and validated through a use case concerning the choice of insulating materials considering heterogeneous criteria that model sustainable constraints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,3]]},"archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-03552184v1","author":[{"family":"Laguna Salvadó","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Villeneuve","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Abi Akle","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Bur","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"lagunasalvado2022_DecisionSupport","container-title":"Building and Environment","container-title-short":"Building and Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108786","ISSN":"0360-1323","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,15]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"108786","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Decision Support System for technology selection based on multi-criteria ranking: Application to NZEB refurbishment","title-short":"Decision Support System for technology selection based on multi-criteria ranking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322000348","volume":"212"},

  {"id":"masson2014_InspirezExplorez","abstract":"My PhD thesis contributes to the engineering of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). It deals with the design of User Interfaces (UI). I claim that creative processes should be better considered, and supported by tools especially for novice designers. The challenge is to speed up the exploration of the design space at the early stages of the process. This claim is grounded in both a theoretical state of the art in creativity and creativity support tools, and in practice of the topic with four hands-on experiences of creativity in different areas of design such as architecture, product design and UI design. I build my contribution on the following principles: (1) creativity is not reserved for the elite, but can be tailored and fostered by software tools; (2) the tools must leverage motivation, inspiration, wide exploration, and knowledge in UI and design processes. Through a reflective process, I apply these principles to my thesis. I explore a wide range of creativity support tools through five complementary software contributions: Maestro and Bank for supporting knowledge capitalization; WebGallery, BrianStorming and Magellan for fostering inspiration and exploration of the design space. Maestro addresses the capitalization of design processes whilst BANK gathers knowledge in HCI as a graph of models. WebGallery is a gallery of websites to inspire designers: I report an experiment on human perception of websites styles. BrianStorming is a brainstorming assistant: it provides suggestions in a electronic brainstorming session. Magellan is an interactive environment based on genetic algorithms that automatically generate and transform UIs for a given design problem. This changes the role of the computer: from a simple tool, it becomes a designer's partner in the creative process.","archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/tel-01549303v1","author":[{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"}],"citation-key":"masson2014_InspirezExplorez","event-place":"Grenoble","genre":"PhD Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,25]]},"language":"fr","license":"All rights reserved","publisher":"Université de Grenoble","publisher-place":"Grenoble","title":"Inspirez !

  {"id":"masson2021_TraceabilityInformation","abstract":"The textile industry is facing ecological and economic crises. Since the rise of fast fashion, the textile industry is one of the major and ever-increasing contributors to pollution\nand waste. Fashion brands are now producing twice the amount of clothing today compared with before the year 2000 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). In the meantime,\nmore consumers become aware of both social and ecological risks in the textile industry\nand do not want to encourage such practices. In 2018, 44clothing and for 40people (18-25\nyears old) (Ditty, n.d.). This phenomenon reveals a growing consumer awareness and a\ngrowing distrust of the industry’s companies. A survey conducted in April 2020 across\n2035 British and German consumers reveals that 64spend less on fashion during the crisis,\nand half of them expect that trend to continue after the crisis passes. As well, consumers\nare open to purchasing more durable fashion items, as well as repairing and keeping them\nlonger. This survey reveals a shift in purchasing behavior, customers want to make informed purchases (Granskog et al., n.d.). The globalized and fragmented textile supply\nchain requires different laws and regulations (Fletcher and Grose, 2012) to improve its\ntransparency. The paper is structured as follow: The first part presents the current situation regarding the transparency of information communicated by brands in store and\nonline, and in the second part, we will describe what information could be shared with\ninformed consumers, after an experiment with a product from a French luxury brand.\nThe first part is the result of a study both in store and online about legal requirements\nand recommendations about traceability information related to products and environmental displays. We compare these requirements with actual data gathered in store and in\nonline-shop. From our initial observations: The consumer survey by Fashion Revolution\nin 2018 and 2020 suggests that fashion labels should be transparent with the disclosure\nof information to consumers: Manufacturer’s address, the origin of fabric, and raw material(Fashion Revolution, 2018) (Fashion Revolution, 2020). In the second part of the\narticle, we focus on the importance of traceability for gathering the information necessary\nfor a full transparency. We leverage how information technology could be used to gather,\ncollect, sort, and select information to render to the consumer.","archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-03462333v1","author":[{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri H"},{"family":"Beler","given":"Cédrick"},{"family":"Legardeur","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Ospital","given":"Pantxika"}],"citation-key":"masson2021_TraceabilityInformation","event-place":"Warsaw, Poland","event-title":"Global Fashion Conference 2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"1–7","publisher-place":"Warsaw, Poland","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Traceability information to communicate to consumer in total transparency","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.science/hal-03462333"},

The draft model we are presenting is gathering 16 areas of information that can be used by the stakeholders of the entire value chain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,4]]},"archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-04082862v1","author":[{"family":"Ospital","given":"Pantxika"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri H."},{"family":"Beler","given":"Cédrick"},{"family":"Legardeur","given":"Jérémy"}],"citation-key":"ospital2023_DevelopingData","container-title":"Sustainable innovation 2023","event-place":"Epsom, United Kingdom","event-title":"Sustainable innovation 2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"8 p.","publisher":"University for the creative arts","publisher-place":"Epsom, United Kingdom","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Toward Developing a Data Model for a Digital Product Passport To Enhance Circularity in Fashion","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.science/hal-04082862"},
  {"id":"ospital2023_ProductTransparency","abstract":"In the textile industry, corporate transparency does not provide information about products that would allow customers to make informed purchases. Based on a literature review, the concept of product transparency is defined as the disclosure of information concerning a specific product about traceability and sustainability conditions for the supplier, as well as the entire lifecycle and the buying firm's purchasing practices. A field study in the current fashion landscape evaluated the situation of actual practices concerning transparency and compared information available online and in-store regarding both product transparency and corporate transparency. The information available at the time of purchase is limited and even more so on the internet. An experiment with a brand to create a customer information model for a specific product focuses on the importance of traceability for gathering the information necessary. The authors discuss the necessity of centralising information in a Digital Product Passport for greater transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,3]]},"archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-03879884v1","author":[{"family":"Ospital","given":"Pantxika"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Beler","given":"Cédrick"},{"family":"Legardeur","given":"Jérémy"}],"citation-key":"ospital2023_ProductTransparency","container-title":"International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education","container-title-short":"Int J Fash Des Technol Educ","DOI":"10.1080/17543266.2022.2142677","ISSN":"1754-3266","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"186-197","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Toward product transparency: communicating traceability information to consumers","title-short":"Toward product transparency","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17543266.2022.2142677","volume":"16"},

However, designing such complex tools and concept requires methods to be correctly implemented. These methods are studied as part of system engineering to satisfy various identified goals, and more specifically human-system integration, which is the topic of this paper. This article introduces the method used to define key elements of human perception of reality called reality anchors to design scenarios to be tested in a digital twin prototype. This method goes from regulation study to user cognitive function analysis on the specific case of digital twin designing in oil-and-gas industry. This method highlighted the differences between theoretical process and the followed process as well as tools and competencies used to identify reality anchors. This knowledge will then be used to implement a new process to be implemented with a digital twin and scenarios to test the prototype using realistic simulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,4]]},"archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-03356551v1","author":[{"family":"Pinto","given":"Stélian Camara Dit"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Villeneuve","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Boy","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Urfels","given":"Laetitia"}],"citation-key":"pinto2021_RequirementsPrototyping","collection-title":"23rd International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED21)","container-title":"Proceedings of the Design Society","container-title-short":"Proc.

This paper presents a methodology to facilitate stakeholders collaboration in the refurbishment processes and identifies decision support approaches to help on the main decision milestones. This methodology is supported by a prototype (user interface and algorithm) of a decision support system (DSS) that allows ranking different refurbishment technologies. The proposed DSS uses a multi criteria decision method that combines weighting and fuzzy dominances approach. The approach is illustrated with a real data set to rank insulation materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,3]]},"archive":"HAL","archive_location":"https://hal.science/hal-02362849v2","author":[{"family":"Salvadό","given":"L.

This new way of managing a farm is a prime area of application for research work on Cyber-Physical and Human Systems. The issue explored in this article is based on the observation that breeders face a considerable increase in the amount of data they must deal with. It is then necessary to develop a decision support system considering the \"real time\" data but also the expert knowledge to allow the farmers to act at best.

  {"id":"williams2024_TinkererMindset","abstract":"Tinkering — or making small changes to experiment toward an improvement in performance — is seemingly a natural characteristic of many systems engineers. As such, systems engineers are uniquely qualified to develop complex solutions necessary to overcome lack of clarity, achieve order, and avoid failure. Further, there is a much broader conversation surrounding the possibility of “failure” being beneficial in systems engineering projects. In response to the needing to inform judgment in situations shrouded in uncertainty, members of INCOSE's Technical Leadership Institute (TLI) cohort 8 examined the role of safe-to-fail probes play in informing judgement for systems engineers. Within the constraints of the TLI's major project, virtual workshops and qualitative interviews were two data collection mechanisms established to empirically investigate the role(s) of safe-to-fail probing in systems engineering. Overall, the data sets offered conclusions describing the potential role(s) of safe-to-fail probes for systems engineers working in uncertain environments. Resulting from this (limited) empirical exploration are additional insights and implications for how systems engineers may invoke safe-to-fail probes to improve decision-making in uncertain and challenging situations. Such a tinkerer's mindset can help systems engineers transition from the constraints of “intolerable failure” to the opportunities related to probing-sensing-responding to “responsible failures.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Adam D."},{"family":"Aveiro","given":"Leandro V."},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Leandri","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Terpant","given":"Guilluame"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Unger","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"williams2024_TinkererMindset","container-title":"INSIGHT","container-title-short":"INSIGHT","DOI":"10.1002/inst.12494","ISSN":"2156-4868","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2024 by Adam D.
