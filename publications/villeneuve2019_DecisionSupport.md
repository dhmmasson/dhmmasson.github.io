## Abstract

While the 7 million-head French sheep industry is contracting, the average herd size is rising, providing challenging issues to maintain and improve its productivity. Precision Livestock Farming has allowed the sheeps and herds to be equipped with sensors and has a result the amount of data to be processed by farmers has surged. We argue that in order for the farmers to take appropriate actions there is a need for the development of a decision support system that take into account not only real-time data but also expert knowledge. In this work, we first highlight the specific challenges presented by the field of precision sheep farming to the development of a Cyber-Physical and Human System. We then introduce a methodology to implement a decision support in this context.
