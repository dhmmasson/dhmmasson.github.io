## Abstract

In the context of the emergence of collaborative innovation projects, the animation of creative sessions permits to identify new opportunities. The number of ideas generated is a lot more important than the number of collaborative projects implemented. To improve this ratio, we assume that group discussions could be facilitated by the cleavage of opinions about the quality of the ideas discussed during the meeting. We support our approach with a digital tool to promote information feedback throughout the session.
