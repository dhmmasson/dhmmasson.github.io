## Abstract

The Textile & Clothing industry is facing systemic and global challenges due both to ecological and economic crises. Today, increasing full traceability of supply chain is one of the key points to optimize production but it should also serve to inform consumers to foster sustainable purchasing decision. We argue that the total traceability of the garment supply chain must be constructed to enable a full transparency for the consumer. In this paper, we will start analysing brands’ transparency communication and describe the particular complexities of the textile supply chain.
