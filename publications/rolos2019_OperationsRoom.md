## Abstract

In this research work we focuses on the elicitation of concepts for the design of an oil and gas complex system involving a fleet of robots. We are using expertise and an experience-based approach to formalize existing control rooms and extending them to include robots. We are building a structural and functional ontology to identify and allocate current and emergent functions. The approach leads to the development of a software simulator that includes structures and functions of an oil and gas platform and its operations room. Keywords Oil and gas, control room, ontology, human centered design, fleet of robots.
