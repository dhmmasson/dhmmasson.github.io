## Abstract

The purpose of the PRODEC scenario-based design method is the incremental crossfertilization and refinement of procedural scenarios and declarative configurations. It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system’s functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC’s use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins.
