## Abstract

Model Driven Engineering (MDE) has focused on the latest stages of the design process so far and as a result has missed the opportunity to foster creativity in the early phases. Our research aims at stretching MDE all over the design process including the creative phases so that to go beyond the well-known "fast-food UIsâ€Ÿ limit of MDE. We propose to consider sketches and prototypes as models. This paper claims for storing these models in a graph so that to both inspire designers and support adaptation at runtime.
