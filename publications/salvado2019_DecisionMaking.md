## Abstract

Decision making in the context of Near Zero Energy Building refurbishment is subjected to heterogeneous stakeholders, tools and objectives. This paper presents a methodology to facilitate stakeholders collaboration in the refurbishment processes and identifies decision support approaches to help on the main decision milestones. This methodology is supported by a prototype (user interface and algorithm) of a decision support system (DSS) that allows ranking different refurbishment technologies. The proposed DSS uses a multi criteria decision method that combines weighting and fuzzy dominances approach. The approach is illustrated with a real data set to rank insulation materials.
