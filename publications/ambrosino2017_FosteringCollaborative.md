## Abstract

In the context of the emergence of collaborative innovation projects between competitiveness clusters, the animation of creative sessions permits to identify new opportunities. The number of ideas generated is a lot more important than the number of collaborative innovation projects implemented subsequently. To improve this ratio, we verify that group discussions could be facilitated by improving the ideation and evaluation phases of ideas during innovation process. Especially, in this article, we test many hypotheses in order to show that divergence of opinions can foster collaborative project emergence.
