## Abstract

Remote and Virtual Towers have been studied as an alternative paradigm for air traffic control operations. This poster introduces research guidelines we obtained from a series of interviews carried out with designers and experts of military air traffic control systems. These are guidelines for a more human-centered approach to systems engineering while designing complex sociotechnical systems such as remote and virtual towers.
