## Abstract

Examples browsing is a common designer practice in user interface design. Several design galleries can be found on Internet. However, those galleries are hand crafted and thus limited and cumbersome to build. In this paper, we claim for tools for supporting both the production and exploration of examples. We describe a running prototype based on Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGA), and relate an early evaluation.
