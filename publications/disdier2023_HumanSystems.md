## Abstract

Remote and virtual centers have been studied for the past twenty years as an alternative to the traditional air traffic control tower environment. Designing such complex sociotechnical systems requires a systems engineering approach that appropriately integrates the human element as well as the technological and organizational components. In this paper, we identify the challenges of implementing this human-systems integration in the design of complex systems. We present the feedback we obtained from a series of semi-structured interviews with people involved in the development of military air traffic solutions. The participants' responses helped us establish methodological guidelines for designing and building a disruptive remote and virtual air traffic control center. We discuss how virtualized humanin-the-loop simulations in particular should help designers analyze user activity and be more flexible in system acquisition.
