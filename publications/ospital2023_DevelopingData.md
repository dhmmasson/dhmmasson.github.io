## Abstract

In the context of a transition to sustainable fashion, a Digital Product Passport could support the circular economy and inform consumers about the sustainability conditions of the products they intend to purchase. This paper presents our methodology to develop a data model of a DPP for the textile industry through a Grounded Theory approach. It results from the convergence of domains of expertise including the evolving legal context in Europe and France, the initiatives of brands to improve consumer information, the growing interest of academics in supply chain traceability and the evolution of stakeholders needs as they become actors of the value chain. The draft model we are presenting is gathering 16 areas of information that can be used by the stakeholders of the entire value chain.
