## Abstract

My PhD thesis contributes to the engineering of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). It deals with the design of User Interfaces (UI). I claim that creative processes should be better considered, and supported by tools especially for novice designers. The challenge is to speed up the exploration of the design space at the early stages of the process. This claim is grounded in both a theoretical state of the art in creativity and creativity support tools, and in practice of the topic with four hands-on experiences of creativity in different areas of design such as architecture, product design and UI design. I build my contribution on the following principles: (1) creativity is not reserved for the elite, but can be tailored and fostered by software tools; (2) the tools must leverage motivation, inspiration, wide exploration, and knowledge in UI and design processes. Through a reflective process, I apply these principles to my thesis. I explore a wide range of creativity support tools through five complementary software contributions: Maestro and Bank for supporting knowledge capitalization; WebGallery, BrianStorming and Magellan for fostering inspiration and exploration of the design space. Maestro addresses the capitalization of design processes whilst BANK gathers knowledge in HCI as a graph of models. WebGallery is a gallery of websites to inspire designers: I report an experiment on human perception of websites styles. BrianStorming is a brainstorming assistant: it provides suggestions in a electronic brainstorming session. Magellan is an interactive environment based on genetic algorithms that automatically generate and transform UIs for a given design problem. This changes the role of the computer: from a simple tool, it becomes a designer's partner in the creative process.
