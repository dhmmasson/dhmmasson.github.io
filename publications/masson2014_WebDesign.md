## Abstract

Web design galleries are extremely popular for searching inspiration in web design, but there is a lack of rich search functions. Recent works in the field have focused on style similarity browsing, where one hops from design to design based on their style similarity. In this paper, we claim for a study of the multiple dimensions of this notion of style, and of its perception by humans. We advocate for ground truth datasets based on a first experiment.
