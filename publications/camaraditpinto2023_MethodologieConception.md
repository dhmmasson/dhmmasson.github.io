## Abstract

The work presented in this article focuses on the opportunity to use the digital twin of the complex system, a concept popularized in recent years, as a Decision Support System. In studying the phenomenon of human decision making, the concept of situation awareness appears to be of primary importance when dealing with these complex systems. Given the complexity of the system to be represented in the digital twin, the concept of reality anchor is proposed to identify the elements of the studied situation necessary for the user to perceive, understand and project the situation he is facing. A methodology, called the Reality Anchor Methodology, has been defined to ensure the elicitation and the implementation of these elements in a digital twin. This methodology is composed of three steps that aim (1) to elicit the reality anchors through a study of the operators’ tasks and activities, (2) to design a prototype for the realization of human-in-the-loop tests and (3) to validate the definition of the reality anchors. This method was applied to a case study in the energy domain and allowed to validate the importance of the defined reality anchors for the decision-making process.
