## Abstract

In the textile industry, corporate transparency, as the disclosure of firm information, does not provide information about products that would allow the customer to make informed purchases. Product transparency as defined by the disclosure of information concerning a specific product is necessary to support distrusting consumer. Among the key actions, setting up a digital product passport (DPP) for textile products is an opportunity to inform consumers. The aim of this paper is to explore the current situation of the industry and the new regulations to develop a DPP data model. We studied the evolution of current fashion landscape, evaluated the situation of actual practices concerning transparency and compared information available online and in-store regarding both product transparency and corporate transparency. We then propose a model of DPP.
