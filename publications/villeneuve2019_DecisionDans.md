## Abstract

Precision livestock farming aims to improve the farm productivity and relies on a set of technological equipment producing data that must be collected, stored and analyzed and concern each animal and its environment. This new way of managing a farm is a prime area of application for research work on Cyber-Physical and Human Systems. The issue explored in this article is based on the observation that breeders face a considerable increase in the amount of data they must deal with. It is then necessary to develop a decision support system considering the "real time" data but also the expert knowledge to allow the farmers to act at best. In this work, we first highlight the specific challenges presented by the field of precision sheep farming to the development of a decision support system. We then introduce a methodology to implement decision support in this context.
