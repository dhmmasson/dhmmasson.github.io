## Abstract

In the textile industry, corporate transparency does not provide information about products that would allow customers to make informed purchases. Based on a literature review, the concept of product transparency is defined as the disclosure of information concerning a specific product about traceability and sustainability conditions for the supplier, as well as the entire lifecycle and the buying firm's purchasing practices. A field study in the current fashion landscape evaluated the situation of actual practices concerning transparency and compared information available online and in-store regarding both product transparency and corporate transparency. The information available at the time of purchase is limited and even more so on the internet. An experiment with a brand to create a customer information model for a specific product focuses on the importance of traceability for gathering the information necessary. The authors discuss the necessity of centralising information in a Digital Product Passport for greater transparency.
