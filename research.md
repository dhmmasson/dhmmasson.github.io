Evolution of my research along the year
[@masson2018_ErgoIA](publications/masson2018_ErgoIA/index.md)

- 2010: Masson's research focused on using evolutionary systems and model-based approaches to foster creativity in User Interface (UI) design. [@masson2010_MagellanEvolutionary] He introduced "Magellan," a system that uses user task models to generate UI sketches, aiming to inspire designers and facilitate the exploration of design space. [@masson2010_MagellanEvolutionary]

- 2011: His work explored the use of interactive genetic algorithms (IGAs) for generating and exploring examples in UI design, arguing for tools that support both the production and exploration of design examples. [@masson2011_ExamplesGalleries] He presented "Magellan" as an interactive evolutionary environment capable of semi-automatically generating example galleries tailored to specific design problems. [@masson2011_InspirerExplorer]

- 2014: Masson completed his PhD thesis, which emphasized the importance of supporting creative processes in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and UI design, particularly for novice designers. [@masson2014_InspirezExplorez] He investigated various creativity support tools and contributed five software applications: Maestro and Bank for knowledge capitalization; WebGallery, BrianStorming, and Magellan for inspiration and design space exploration. [@masson2014_InspirezExplorez] He also explored style similarity browsing in web design galleries and highlighted the need for studying the perception of style in web design. [@masson2014_WebDesign]
- 2015: His research explored ways to showcase interactive features in web design galleries. [@pena-arrazola2015_InteractiveGalleries] He presented "I++," a web design gallery focusing on highlighting innovative interactive features in websites. [@pena-arrazola2015_InteractiveGalleries]
- 2016: Masson focused on facilitating collaborative innovation and improving creative sessions. [@ambrosino2016_EncourageExchanges] He explored the use of digital tools to provide feedback and promote the discussion of ideas during creative sessions, with the aim of increasing the implementation of collaborative projects. [@ambrosino2016_EncourageExchanges] His work also involved developing methodologies and animation guidelines for facilitating project emergence in collaborative innovation contexts, particularly within interclustering and cross-sectoral settings. [@ambrosino2016_MethodologyProject]
- 2017: His research explored the impact of divergence of opinions on fostering collaborative project emergence. [@ambrosino2017_FosteringCollaborative] He conducted research to validate hypotheses related to the positive influence of differing viewpoints on the success of collaborative projects. [@ambrosino2017_FosteringCollaborative] His work also focused on developing tangible user interfaces for monitoring ideation during creative sessions. [@ambrosino2017_IdeaBulbSmart] He presented "IdeaBulb," a tangible UI designed to provide real-time feedback on idea generation dynamics, aiding participants and facilitators in understanding the creative process. [@ambrosino2017_IdeaBulbSmart] He further refined the methodology for facilitating collaborative innovation projects. [@ambrosino2017_STARMethodologie]
- 2019: Masson's research expanded into new areas, including the development of decision support systems for building refurbishment and the definition of semantic spaces for integrating user perceptions in design. [@lagunasalvado2019_OutilClassement, @millet2019_DefinitionEspace] He focused on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches to aid decision-makers in navigating complex technology choices in NZEB refurbishment. [@salvado2019_DecisionMaking] He also examined the challenges and opportunities in precision livestock farming, particularly in the context of decision support systems. [@villeneuve2019_DecisionSupport]
- 2021: His research delved into the role of digital twins in supporting situation awareness and decision-making in complex systems. [@camaraditpinto2021_DigitalTwin] He investigated the design requirements for digital twins, focusing on enhancing situation awareness in the context of downgraded situations management. [@camaraditpinto2021_DigitalTwin] He also began exploring the use of digital product passports (DPPs) in the textile industry to enhance transparency and support circularity. [@masson2021_TraceabilityInformation]
- 2022: His work explored the design and development of digital twins, specifically focusing on human-system integration. [@camaraditpinto2023_MethodologieConception, @pinto2021_RequirementsPrototyping] He explored circular product design methodologies and proposed the "Unlinear Method" to promote circularity in product design, particularly in the context of garment and shoe recycling. [@demarcq2022_CircularProduct] He continued researching digital product passports (DPPs), exploring their potential to enhance product transparency and circularity. [@ospital2022_DigitalProduct, @ospital2022_PasseportProduit] He also examined the use of DPPs to promote traceability and transparency in the textile supply chain throughout a product's life cycle. [@ospital2022_PasseportProduit]
- 2023: Masson's research further examined the use of physiological responses in understanding creative thinking processes and the potential for developing adaptive creativity support tools. [@houzangbe2023_ExplorationPhysiological] He explored physiological arousal during divergent and convergent thinking using different sketching tools, aiming to identify physiological markers for different creative phases. [@houzangbe2023_ExplorationPhysiological] He continued his research on digital product passports, developing a data model for DPPs in the fashion industry to enhance circularity. [@ospital2023_DevelopingData]
- 2024: His work examined the operational context of complex sociotechnical systems, emphasizing the importance of human-systems integration. [@boy2024_PRODECHuman, @disdier2024_DefiningCharacterizing] He contributed to the development of "PRODEC," a scenario-based design method for human-system integration in increasingly autonomous systems. [@boy2024_PRODECHuman] He also researched a human-centered approach to the design and operation of remote and virtual air traffic control centers, highlighting the importance of considering human factors in complex systems. [@disdier2024_DefiningCharacterizing]

This timeline shows how Masson's research interests evolved from UI design and creativity support to encompass a broader range of topics including collaborative innovation, digital twins, human-system integration, and sustainability in design and manufacturing. His work reflects a focus on human-centered design principles and the use of technology to enhance human capabilities and decision-making.
